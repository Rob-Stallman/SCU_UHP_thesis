## Section 1: Introduction and Literature Review
### 1.A: Context
Commercial nuclear power plants have played a key role in satisfying the United States’ energy demand for over 60 years. As of 2020, nearly 20% of the country’s energy generation was nuclear in origin <SITE>. With 94 reactors at 56 different power plants <SITE>, nuclear power will continue to be an important part of the United States’ energy generation mix for the foreseeable future. This is good in that the electricity produced from nuclear power plants has zero carbon emissions directly associated with it. The ecological destruction wrought by global, human-caused climate change continues to prove that the world cannot continue to rely on carbon-emitting power plants. However, the radioactive waste produced in the process of generating this carbon-free electricity poses a supremely hazardous problem that has yet to be addressed effectively.

Nuclear waste is a uniquely problematic type of waste in that it not only poses an immediate safety risk, but will continue to do so for millennia after its generation. Storage methods are typically broken down into two categories: short-term and long-term. Short-term storage entails the prolonged submersion of nuclear fuel rods immediately after they are removed from the reactor for anywhere from 5 years to multiple decades, followed by the encasement of the rods in layers of cement and steel. Long-term storage requires isolation of the waste for millenia, which suggests a host of challenges. No country in the world currently has an operational long-term storage plan<SITE>.

The prevailing idea for a long-term storage plan involves burying robustly engineered capsules containing high level waste deep underground in a structure typically referred to as a repository <SITE>. These repositories are meant to sequester even the most highly toxic wastes for thousands of years, by which time the radioactive decay of the dangerous isotopes will have lowered the overall toxicity of the waste to a similar level as might be found naturally. To design such a structure that might effectively achieve this goal would be a significant engineering achievement, but the physical containment mechanism is only one piece of this very important puzzle.

A key factor in designing an effective long-term repository is the proper selection of the repository location. Rigorous study of the geologic conditions of a potential repository site is critical to ensure that, in the event of waste capsule degradation over time or due to seismic activity, the stored nuclear waste will not transport to the surface via mechanisms such as sorption in appreciable amounts. Transportation to the surface represents a significant threat to human and non-human wellbeing alike, as either might unwittingly make use of contaminated water in one way or another. The process for evaluating a repository location in such a manner is referred to as a performance assessment (PA). As one might imagine, detailed nuclear waste characteristic data are key input parameters for accurate PAs.

As such, nearly all previous PAs have considered repositories designed to dispose of waste from the current once-through, uranium-powered light-water reactor (LWR) fuel cycle <SITE>. Future PAs may have to consider wastes from different types of advanced fuel cycles for which the reactor design(s), recycling schemes, and waste forms may substantially alter the waste management and disposal requirements. Thus, understanding and comparing waste characteristics is critical for developing a comprehensive waste management strategy.

### 1.B: Scope
A visualization tool called FCP (short for Fuel Cycle Plotter) has been developed in order to make waste characteristic data from a variety of fuel cycles more readily accessible to researchers, policy makers, and the general public. A primary function of this new tool is to generate time-dependent plots of key nuclear waste characteristics including radioactivity profiles, waste composition, and more. The tool includes data for 40 different fuel cycles <SITE> at various stages of development, including the LWR fuel cycle currently used in commercial nuclear power generation in the United States.

By virtue of having multiple fuel cycles to study, possible use cases for FCP extend beyond providing input parameters for repository performance assessment. Using the tool, up to three different fuel cycles can be selected at a time for comparison. In the event that a fuel cycle produces multiple waste streams (e.g. an off-gas stream from aqueous separations such as PUREX or a ceramic waste stream from electrochemical separations), the user also has the option to make comparisons between individual streams. For each waste form stream selected, the user has the option to plot the selected waste characteristic for individual isotopes or elements, or select from several different overarching nuclide species (e.g. actinides, fission products, transuranics). The FCP waste stream selection options are shown in Fig. XX. In this way, making comparisons between and among fuel cycles on the basis of waste production becomes a streamlined process, enabling quick and easy analysis and well-informed decision-making.

![Figure 1](/assets/images/cart_form.png)
<figcaption>Figure 1. Screen capture of a form in FCP which allows the user to select the waste streams and waste characteristics that they would like to see plotted. Two evaluation groups (EGs), EG01 and EG23, have been selected for comparison here. An EG is a collection of fuel cycle options with similar fundamental physics characteristics, e.g., a thermal reactor with a critical irradiation environment. Each EG has an associated Analysis Example (AE) which further specifies fuel type(s) and reactor technology(s) so that quantitative data could be generated to inform further analysis. The AE for EG01 only has one waste stream, so in this instance the stream called “Stage 1 SNF” is equivalent to the fuel cycle total. The AE for EG23 has multiple waste streams due to the reprocessing methods used in this EG. In this case, the user may select one or more waste streams at a time for analysis. There are four characteristics of the waste stream data available for plotting: radiotoxicity, radioactivity, heat generation, and waste composition. Finally, there are a number of different ways to select the specific nuclides which will be displayed in the FCP-generated plot, from as specific as a single isotope to as broad as the sum of all products in the waste stream.</figcaption>

### 1.C: Project History
The forty fuel cycles included in FCP are defined in a 2014 U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) report entitled “Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation and Screening” (FCES) <SITE>. The authors of the report attempted to organize 4,398 unique “fuel cycle option groups” into a comprehensive set of “Evaluation Groups” (EGs) according to “all major aspects of a fuel cycle that may affect the content and disposition of all materials” <SITE>. From each Evaluation Group, a representative “Analysis Example” was selected “to perform the reactor physics analyses … to inform on the metric data” <SITE>. As such, the data represented in FCP is specific to the Analysis Example selected for each Evaluation Group. A brief description of each Analysis Example is included in the catalog of this application, along with a link to the corresponding page in Appendix B of the FCES report, where more information is available.

The data underlying FCP is generated using a software package called “Nuclear Waste Analysis in Python” (nwpy, pronounced “nu-pie") that was developed “to characterize waste streams using FCES data including mass balances, discharged fuel composition(s), and details about fuel cycle technologies such as reactor type and reprocessing method” <SITE>. In order to generate this data, nwpy interfaces with the ORIGEN-S and OPUS modules from the SCALE code suite developed by Oak Ridge National Lab <SITE>. FCP enables easy visualization of the data produced by the nwpy package, which was generated locally during the course of the development of FCP and is now stored in a Postgres database hosted on the Heroku platform <SITE>. FCP manages the data using the pandas library <SITE> for Python and displays it via a front end built using the Flask micro web framework <SITE> and the Bokeh library <SITE> for Python.

## Section 2: Building Process
### 2.A: Initial Steps - HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript
I began by designing the user interface (UI) for FCP using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. The guiding principle behind the early stages of the building process was that the web application should be intuitive and fun to use. Thus, I modelled the UI to mirror an online-shopping catalog. The idea was that a user could log on, sift through a catalog of fuel cycles, and add to their “cart” the ones they wanted to learn more about. A mock-up of this early-stage design is shown in Figure XX, and the first edition of the webpage is shown in Figure XX.

![Figure 3](/assets/images/first_edition.png)
<figcaption>Figure 3. The first edition of the homepage of FCP written with HTML and CSS. The webpage was purely static at this point because I had not yet introduced any JavaScript.</figcaption>

To allow users to sort through the catalog quickly and effectively, I wanted them to be able to filter in or out the fuel cycles that appear in the catalog based on several discriminators. Initially, I attempted to integrate this interactivity into FCP using exclusively JavaScript. The goal was to use “on-click” events in JavaScript to make the items on the catalog page appear or disappear based on the buttons that were clicked in the filter sidebar (see left panel of Fig XX). However, I immediately ran into a problem involving JavaScript function parameters. I assigned several class attributes to the HTML element for each EG in the catalog according to the six discriminating factors that were used in the FCES study <SITE>. For example, since EG01 includes once-through, critical, thermal neutron spectrum reactor designs which burn enriched uranium, the HTML for the EG01 catalog element looks like:
```
<li class="mix once_through critical thermal feed_U enrich_yes" style="width:100%">
    <h3>EG01 Analysis Example <a href="../static/FCES_Appendix_B.pdf#page=90" target="_blank">(Details)</a></h3>
    <p>Once-through in PWR using uranium fuel</p>
    {% raw %}{{ compare_form.eg01() }}
    {{ compare_form.eg01.label }}{% endraw %}
</li>
```
I wanted to use these class attributes as parameters for a function that would toggle the visibility of an HTML element based on whether or not the corresponding button in the filter had been selected, e.g., if “Limited-recycle” were selected under “Recycle Strategy,” the HTML element for EG01 should disappear. However, I found that I couldn’t directly pass parameters to the function associated with the “on-click” events in Javascript which listens for a button selection. I worked around this problem by nesting another function that <em>did</em> allow me to include parameters within the event function, but this success was short-lived. I soon realized that JavaScript would not be the most efficient language to use when designing my website’s back-end, or the layer of the website that holds the data to be shared.

The issues I was running into with the filtering capability of the website were indicative of a larger hurdle in building a full-stack web application (that is, an application that includes both a front-end and a back-end). Namely, I had to focus on how to make my application receive a user query, retrieve from the back-end of the application the data most relevant to that query, and  then provide the information back to the user in a format consistent with the original query. A common group of tools used to accomplish such tasks is called the “LAMP'' stack, which is an acronym for the Linux operating system, Apache web server, MySQL database, and the scripting language PHP <SITE>. It seemed that my attempts to implement dynamic content to the website were ushering me toward using the LAMP stack, which would add much more functionality than I really needed. This problem was compounded by the fact that the program which would be generating all the underlying data for the site, nwpy, was written in Python. It seemed that working with the data in a web application would be much easier if the web application could be written in Python as well, so I began to look for ways to do that.

### 2.B: Next Steps - Python, Flask, and Heroku
In moving to Python-based web development, I was motivated by two design principles:
1. Don’t compromise on any of the functionality goals for the project.
2. Minimize the amount of extraneous functionality.

There are two main tools that web developers use when writing in Python: a framework called Django, and a microframework called Flask. Both tools are open source frameworks that aid in the web development process, but Flask is a “microframework” in that it comes with fewer extensions automatically installed <SITE>. Flask seemed like the right tool for my project, because it would allow me to add only the functionality that I really needed and avoid any of the extra tools like user authentication that weren’t really necessary for the project. In addition, I learned about a “platform as a service” called Heroku <SITE> which would allow me to host a Flask-built application for free, and for which there were significant resources online about how to publish a Flask-built application. I decided that the Flask microframework would satisfy my design principles, so I began to learn more about how to collect user-specific data from the front-end and work with that data on the back-end of the Flask-built application.

To work with forms in Flask, I first needed to add a module called “flask_wtf” into my library. This allowed me to define forms for the front-end of the web application as objects, which made the form data easily parsable on the back-end. Using this module, I created a form to collect information from the user a “cart” page regarding the specific nuclear waste data they wanted to study. I knew the requested data would typically include the Evaluation Group (EG), stage of the fuel cycle, waste form (ceramic, glass, etc.), data type (radioactivity, radiotoxicity, etc.), and the category of data (Actinides, specific isotopes, etc.), so I needed to create a database from which specific subsets of data could be accessed for plotting according to the form responses.

For the purpose of the development stage, the database that I used was SQLite, and the database library that I added to my Flask app was called SQLAlchemy. I began by generating and storing data only for the most basic fuel cycle, EG01, for which I had already generated 4 CSV files using nwpy. Loading the data into the database required two steps for each CSV file: creating a Pandas dataframe of each file using the “to_csv” method and then connecting that dataframe to the established database using the “to_sql” method. These two steps enabled me to run a single script to  transfer all the CSV files containing the waste data from my hard drive into a database that could eventually be hosted remotely. Developing the means to transfer files in this simple and efficient way was a critical step in moving the complete version of FCP toward deployment.

With the data successfully stored in my development database, I then wrote code that could retrieve and plot subsets of this data as specified by a form on the front-end of FCP. The form responses for the EG, fuel cycle stage, waste form, and data type could all be parsed such that they only referred to a single table within my database. Each table includes several hundred rows (one for each isotope that might appear in any given waste stream), so to retrieve only the data that was specified in the form I needed a way to search through the table and select only the rows of data that were relevant. I found that this was best accomplished by creating a Pandas dataframe out of the table using the “read_sql_table” method. Then I could use Python commands to parse through the dataframe and create a dictionary of data categories and their associated Pandas series, which I could plot. For the plotting, I turned to the Python library called Bokeh <SITE> because of its interactive features. With forty EGs (some with as many as 10 waste streams) and hundreds of isotopes per waste stream, the plots can become overwhelmingly complex very easily. I wanted to find the right balance between preventing a user from creating an overly-complex plot and allowing them to compare a variety of waste data to see how selecting different options could change the waste profile over time. I decided to allow the user to select a maximum of three total waste streams per plot and a maximum of eight total data categories (individual isotopes, elements, or species) per waste stream.

Once the data for the simplest EG was stored in the development database and able to be made into plots, I scaled-up the database to include the other 39 EGs as well. In doing so, I wanted to “benchmark” the data that a user would see in the plots against a few data “standards” included in the FCES report: radioactivity of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and high-level waste (HLW) at both 100 years and 100,000 years. I also included the useful benchmarking metric of SNF + HLW mass because it can indicate why other metric data points may be skewed in one direction or another. To perform this benchmarking evaluation, the data points that were generated by nwpy and displayed in FCP were linearly interpolated to obtain the characteristic values at relevant times. Although the data are exponential, a linear interpolation between tightly spaced values provided a good first-order verification of the method.

Table 1 displays the ratio of values provided for three metrics as reported in FCP vs. the FCES report. (A ratio of 1.0 implies  perfect agreement between analyses.) The two analyses give results that are within 5% for almost all EGs. Values for which the percent difference exceeds 5% can be attributed to differences in waste stream processing assumptions between the FCES study and nwpy, as explained in <SITE>. The nomenclature used for each fuel cycle ID code (shown in column 1 of Table 1) is:
<p>[Evaluation group number].[recycle strategy]–[reactor type(s)]–[fuel type(s)]</p>

### 2.C: Final Steps - Deploying FCP with PostgreSQL and Heroku Postgres
Based on my benchmarking evaluation, I determined that the data I had been storing locally and working with exclusively in the development database for this project was ready to be moved to a deployment database, which would allow FCP to become publicly available. To host FCP publicly, I used the Heroku and Git command line interfaces (CLIs) to create a Heroku app and connect it to my local development project. At this point, the complete front-end of FCP was publicly accessible. Users from any machine could navigate to the URL associated with my Heroku application and look through the catalog or read the “about” page, but if they tried to create any plots, they would see an error message due to the lack of a populated database connected to the application. To build a deployment-ready database for the application, I first created a local PostgreSQL database where I could transfer all of the data I had stored in my local SQLite database. Once I had ensured that all the data had been properly transferred, I then pushed the PostgreSQL database to Heroku’s cloud-based database service called Heroku Postgres. With this step, FCP became fully-functional on May 6, 2021.

## Section 3: Examples - Use Cases
The fuel cycle plotter FCP can be used to study the individual waste characteristics of any radioactive waste stream generated by any fuel cycle that was studied in the FCES. It can also be used to make comparisons between different waste streams of a given fuel cycle, or even between waste streams from different fuel cycles.

A particularly important fuel cycle to understand is the commonly used once-through, enriched uranium, pressurized water reactor (PWR) cycle which is the standard for commercial nuclear power generation in the United States. This cycle is referred to in the FCES as EG01. The different stages of this fuel cycle are shown in Figure XX.

![Figure 4](/assets/images/eg01_schematic.png)
<figcaption>Figure 4. A schematic diagram of the fuel cycle defined in the FCES study as EGO1: natural uranium is enriched, irradiated in a pressurized water reactor, and sent to disposal. This fuel cycle is the standard for commercial nuclear power generation in the United States.</figcaption>

In the EG01 process, natural uranium (NU) is enriched and used to make low enriched uranium (LEU) oxide fuel, which is then irradiated in a PWR and used to generate energy at a net thermal efficiency of 33% and an average discharge burnup (a measure of how much energy is extracted per metric ton of heavy metal) of 50 GW-days/ton <SITE>. There is no recycling of nuclear materials in this fuel cycle; everything gets sent to storage to cool and will eventually need to be sent to a long-term repository in the form of depleted uranium (DU) or discharged fuel (DF). The total radiotoxicity over time from EG01 is shown in Figure XX.

![Figure 5](/assets/images/eg01_tox.png)
<figcaption>Figure XX. A plot produced by FCP to show the radiotoxicity of the spent nuclear fuel produced by EG01, all of which is sent to a storage and disposal facility without any reprocessing.</figcaption>

There are several important points to note when looking at plots produced by FCP. First, all plots begin at 5 years, because nwpy accounts for 5 years of cooling time for the immediately discharged fuel from the reactor. Second, FCP-produced plots are on a log-log scale, which makes them appear linear because radioactive decay is an exponential process. (On a linear scale, these plots would appear to be a very tall “L” shape.) Finally, it’s important to note that the plots produced by FCP are normalized to 100 GW-years (electricity) from the entire fuel cycle. For context, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reports that 789.92 billion kWh of electricity was generated by nuclear power plants in 2020 <SITE>. That’s just over 90% of the normalization factor used in FCP. Roughly speaking, the radiotoxicity that you see in the plots produced by FCP are associated with the amount of nuclear waste that was generated in the United States last year alone (2020). When one considers that commercial nuclear plants in the United States have been active for over 60 years (not to mention non-commercial waste generation), the scope of the issue of nuclear waste disposal becomes readily apparent.

An important question that one might ask when looking at the plot in Figure XX is what are the main contributors to the total radiotoxicity? Including the data for the fission products and actinides within the waste stream (see Figure XX), it is clear that fission products dominate the waste stream for the first 20 to 30 years, after which point actinides are the main contributor. Based on the plot, you may think that actinides represent the greatest threat to future populations who may live nearby a long-term repository. However, it is critical to remember that the plots generated by FCP are strictly indicative of the waste material’s characteristics over time; the true risk that any waste poses to the environment also depends on the geologic and engineered conditions of the repository.

![Figure 6](/assets/images/eg01_tox_extended.png)
<figcaption>Figure 6. A plot produced by FCP to show how several isotopes and species contribute to the total radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel from EG01. The main contributors are the actinide elements (in orange), although the long-lived fission products Tc-99 and I-129 (in green and light blue, respectively) are considered more hazardous in terms of long-term disposal because they are more likely to reach the biosphere over long periods of time.</figcaption>

The plot in Figure XX accurately reflects the fact that once the short-lived fission products have had a few half-lives worth of time to decay, they are replaced by elements in the actinides group as the main contributor to radiotoxicity. Although radiotoxicity has historically been used as a metric for risk, many scholars today recognize the inaccuracy of such a direct association <SITE, SITE>. In reality, the long-term risk is highest for Tc-99 and I-129 (also shown in Figure XX) due to “their solubility and greater release rate from the waste solid, their long half lives, and their weak sorption on rock” <SITE>.

Reducing long-term radiotoxicity risks is only one reason for removing and reprocessing actinide elements from a waste stream. Consider the fuel cycle EG23, which was identified in the FCES report as offering the greatest potential benefit for the smallest challenge in development and deployment of any other fuel cycle considered. The benefit that the DOE authors considered was in the form of a “non-dimensional benefit utility” that equally weighted “Nuclear Waste Management, Resource Utilization, Environmental Impact, and Safety” <SITE>.The analysis example for this EG involves a sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) that continuously recycles Pu and U. A diagram of this fuel cycle is shown in Figure XX.

![Figure 7](/assets/images/eg23_schematic.png)
<figcaption>Figure 7. A schematic diagram of the fuel cycle defined in the FCES study as EG23: natural uranium is fed into a sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR), then reprocessed to remove uranium and plutonium from the discharged fuel so that these products can be recycled into the core. This fuel cycle was identified in the FCES report as presenting the greatest potential benefit for the smallest challenge in development and deployment of any other fuel cycle considered.</figcaption>

The EG23 process requires the input of natural uranium (NU), but the uranium does not need to be enriched (as it does for EG01). The SFR core consists of a driver and a blanket, each of which gets fed NU. In the driver, the NU becomes part of a U-Pu-Zr ternary metallic fuel which is irradiated to a burnup of 81.5 GW-day/ton. In the blanket, the NU becomes part of a U-Pu binary metallic fuel which is irradiated to 23.5 GW-day/ton. Used fuel is reprocessed to recover Pu and U, which is then recycled into the core <SITE>. This fuel cycle generates electricity at a net thermal efficiency of 40%, with an average burnup of 72.6 GW-day/ton. Several factors contribute to the improved performance of this fuel cycle over EG01; a list of relevant characteristics for the EG01 and EG23 fuel cycles is shown in Table 2.

<figcaption>Table 2. Fuel Cycle Characteristics of EG01 and EG23.</figcaption>
| Characteristic | EG01 | EG23 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Recycle strategy | once-through | continuous 
| Irradiation environment | critical | critical 
| Neutron spectrum | thermal | fast 
| Feed element | U | U 
| Recycled element | n/a | U and Pu 
| Enrichment | yes | no 

The ability to use and recycle U and Pu, as well as the fast neutron spectrum associated with EG23 are two characteristics that contribute to the improved performance of this fuel cycle over EG01. Recycling U and Pu provides the benefit of increased natural resource utilization; the recovered elements can be used multiple times before being sent to long-term disposal, thus increasing the burnup of the fuel cycle. Furthermore, the fast spectrum of the SFR should result in increased fission of non-fissile transuranics such as Pu and Am that are normally accumulated in LWRs. A smaller concentration of these hazardous products in the waste stream may result in a stronger safety case for the repository in which it is disposed.

![Figure 8](/assets/images/eg23_eg01_tox.png)
<figcaption>Figure 8. A plot produced by FCP to show how the total waste product radiotoxicity from EG01 (solid) and EG23 (dashed) compare over several decades of years. The fast neutron spectrum and the recycling of U and Pu in EG23 are two factors which contribute to the lower radiotoxicity profile for this fuel cycle.</figcaption>

Figure XX shows radiotoxicity plotted against time ranging from five years to 10,000,000 years for EG01 and EG23. The two fuel cycles are differentiated in the figure by linestyle. The plot shows that radiotoxicity of the waste from EG23 is nominally a factor of 4 less than that from EG01 for the first 6,000 years, after which the factor increases to roughly 10. The radiotoxicity for wastes from EG23 is less than that for wastes from EG01 for the reasons previously mentioned. Comparison of these fuel cycles using FCP  thus confirms that EG23 is more efficient than the standard EG01 cycle, and that EG23 produces a total waste stream with lower radiotoxicity than the standard EG01 cycle.

## Section 4: Conclusions and Future Work
The online tool developed for this thesis, FCP (or Fuel Cycle Plotter), enables a straightforward method for analyzing the nuclear waste profile of several important fuel cycles.  By allowing a high degree of customizability within the plotting feature of FCP, one can quickly conduct a general study of any nuclear fuel cycle included in the <em>2014 Department of Energy Fuel Cycle Evaluation and Screening Report</em>, which claimed to have organized 4,398 unique “fuel cycle option groups” according to “all major aspects of a fuel cycle that may affect the content and disposition of all materials” <SITE>. A general study of this kind, though an important step in the analysis of a fuel cycle’s waste characteristics, is just one part of the greater process of planning for long-term nuclear waste storage. FCP also represents a novel approach toward making important quantitative comparisons between advanced fuel cycles. Such analysis is critical in the development of a long-term nuclear waste storage and management strategy in the United States. Our National strategy must take into account the waste characteristics of the currently-used fuel cycle as well as advanced fuel cycles that might be used in the near future. The publicity of FCP as a web application will hopefully allow for wide-spread access to and engagement with this information.
